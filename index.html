	<h1 id="intro">Hello!</h1>
	<p>My name is Ashley Bloodgood. I live in New Jersey with my dog Molly. I'm in my third class pursuing a Master's in Software Development. 
	I have a Bachelor's in Physics from Drew University. I also have a Bachelor's in Information Technology from the 
	University of Massachusetts Lowell. I really enjoyed the classes I took for both of these degrees. </p>

	<p> I currently work for <a href="https://www.saab.com/markets/united-states">Saab Inc.</a> as a systems engineer. I have over five years of experience in systems engineering. Before Saab, I worked
	for Lockheed Martin. I really enjoy the work I do, it is challenging and exciting. At Saab, I get to work from home which Molly <i>loves</i>! </p>
