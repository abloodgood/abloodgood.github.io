	  I was diagnosed with celiac disease in 2019 and since then I've been on a quest to adapt some of my old favorites into gluten free recipes. 
	  They don't always work out as planned but these muffins are always a crowd pleaser! I use King Arthur 1-to-1 gluten free flour to make these
	  but any gluten free cup-for-cup flour should work well. If you don't use cup-for-cup flour, you'll need to add your own zantham gum. I adapted 
	  this recipe from <a href="https://thesaltymarshmallow.com/cinnamon-sugar-donut-muffins/#recipe">The Salty Marshmallow</a>.
  </p>
